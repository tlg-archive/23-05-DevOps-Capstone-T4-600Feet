It's a world in itself, a metal giant that flows through the undersea depths, carrying a diverse crew of sailors into the unknown. But within the confines of this steel vessel, reality begins to blur, and sanity is a fragile commodity.\n As you walk the fine line between reality and illusion, your interactions with the crew will determine your journey. Will you uncover the truth of what's happening on board, or will you succumb to the inevitable madness that lurks in the sub’s dark corners?\nThere are several objects and people on board that may point you in the right direction of what’s going on. Be careful not to linger, as actions will drain what’s left of your sanity…\n",
