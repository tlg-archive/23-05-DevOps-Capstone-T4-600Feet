	"description": "In the depths of the ocean, where sunlight rarely pierces through the water's murky veil, there you live aboard a submarine. It's a world in itself, a metal giant that flows through the undersea depths, carrying a diverse crew of sailors into the unknown. But within the confines of this steel vessel, reality begins to blur, and sanity is a fragile commodity.\n As you walk the fine line between reality and illusion, your interactions with the crew will determine your journey. Will you uncover the truth of what's happening on board, or will you succumb to the inevitable madness that lurks in the sub’s dark corners?\nThere are several objects and people on board that may point you in the right direction of what’s going on. Be careful not to linger, as actions will drain what’s left of your sanity…\n",
	"intro":"\nYou wake up in a dimly lit cabin onboard to the smell of must, metal, and cheap cleaning supplies. You walk to the galley, dreading the idea of unseasoned, barely-heated, frozen meat in a stale taco shell.\nAt any point, you can type 'help' to bring up valid commands",
